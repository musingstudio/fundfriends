# Fund Your Friends
A personal marketplace for selling Web3.1 **NFPs** (Neat, Fun Pictures).

It includes all you care about from Web3 -- decentralization! interoperability! payments! -- but without the pointless complexity of cryptocurrency and blockchains.

**NOTE: This is still being built for public use. Source code coming soon.**

## How it works
FYF is a tiny web application that provides a storefront for selling JPEGs. Once someone purchases your JPEG via Stripe checkout link, they'll be able to download a higher-resolution version and optionally leave their name as a supporting patron to be displayed on the storefront.

The application is built in Go, and distributed as an executable -- just reverse-proxy to it to integrate it into your site. Payments are supported via Stripe, and data is stored in a JSON file. 

## Purpose
Make a little money from your work as a creative, creator, artist, or whatever you might call yourself -- without forcing your friends to buy Dogecoin. Friends can support you financially by buying a neat, fun picture of yours over the Web3 (World Wide Web).

## Improvements
FYF and our world-shattering Web4 NFP technology shares the following traits with Web3 tech and NFT marketplaces:

* You can sell JPEGs
* People can buy your JPEGs
* You can tell other people that you bought a JPEG, and they might think you're cooler for it

Where FYF improves on yesterday's web3 tech, and ushers in a new day of web6:

* Get paid in money you can also use for rent and groceries
* Your grandma doesn't have to first buy internet coins to support you
* Buyers "own" your art on their hard drive in an interoperable format (JPEG)
* Self-host your store -- _decentralization!_
* Transactions aren't broadcasted on a public ledger
* Pyramid-shaped financial schemes not supported out of the box
* Requires less electricity than all of Argentina to operate
